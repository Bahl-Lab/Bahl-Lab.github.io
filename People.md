## Principle Investigator

<img align="middle" src="/Labmems/JBahl-HeadShot.jpg" title="Justin Bahl" width="80" height="100">

Dr. Justin Bahl is a professor at the University of Georgia, holding joint appointments in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the College of Public Health, and the Institute of Bioinformatics. His research focuses on the ecology, evolution, and epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases, with a particular interest in RNA viruses such as influenza A. Dr. Bahl earned his PhD in Molecular Systematics from The University of Hong Kong in 2006. He has held academic positions at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore and the University of Texas School of Public Health in Houston before joining UGA in 2018. In 2023, he was promoted to professor. His work emphasizes understanding how factors like population structure, host immune pressure, and transmission dynamics influence viral genetic diversity. Dr. Bahl is also the academic lead for the Georgia Pathogen Genomics Center of Excellence, a CDC-funded initiative aimed at advancing pathogen genomics and public health response. 

Research in the group is interdiscilinary and highly collaborative. We value input from team members with broad research training. Interested in joinging the Bahl Lab? We have openings for talented and motivated PhD students and Post-Doctoral researchers.
